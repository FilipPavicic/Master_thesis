Abstract:
This master’s thesis introduces a novel approach to student identification during
exams and knowledge tests. The proposed method utilizes a matrix template on the
exam sheet, where students selectively mark squares by entering digits corresponding
to their unique academic citizen identification number. A specialized deep learning
model, based on a modified U-Net architecture, has been developed to accurately recognize
and interpret the marked squares within the matrix template. The designed
model achieves high accuracy in identifying the entered student IDs within the template
while disregarding data noise. Furthermore, an application has been developed
that utilizes the trained model to provide the functionality of predicting student identification
numbers based on scanned sections of the exam containing the template. The
introduction of this innovative identification system represents a notable advancement
in the field of exams and knowledge tests, replacing the conventional manual entry of
personal data with an efficient, fast, and accurate identification procedure.

Keywords: student identification, multi-label detection, U-Net, automated identification
process, deep learning model.
